**The Proposed Model**
The Proposed Model in this research is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed 
specifically to detect early signs of Alzheimer’s disease from MRI scans. CNNs are ideal for image 
classification tasks due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies and complex 
patterns from image data. The model architecture consists of the following layers: 
1. Input Layer: Takes in the resized MRI images as input, with each image normalized to a 
consistent pixel range. 
2. Convolutional Layers: These layers apply multiple filters to extract low-level features such 
as edges and textures, gradually moving to more complex patterns in deeper layers. The 
CNN captures local dependencies in the image, making it suitable for recognizing subtle 
changes in brain structures that might indicate early Alzheimer’s signs. 
3. Max-Pooling Layers: These layers are used to down sample the feature maps, reducing 
their dimensionality while retaining important information. 
4. Fully Connected Layers: These dense layers integrate the features learned by the 
convolutional layers and make the final classification decision. 
5. Activation Function: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is used as the activation function to 
introduce non-linearity, helping the network learn complex patterns in the data. 
6. Dropout Layer: Dropout is employed during training to reduce overfitting by randomly 
setting a fraction of the input units to zero. 
7. Output Layer: The final layer uses a SoftMax activation function to output probabilities 
indicating whether the MRI scan belongs to a patient with Alzheimer’s disease or a healthy 
control. 
The CNN model is trained using backpropagation and the Adam optimizer to minimize the loss 
function, which is typically categorical cross-entropy for binary classification. 
**DATASETS & TOOLS **
1. Dataset: 
• ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative): This publicly available 
dataset provides MRI scans of Alzheimer's patients and healthy controls along with 
clinical data. 
• Preprocessing Steps: Images are resized, normalized, and augmented to ensure 
consistency and prevent overfitting. 
2. Tools & Frameworks: 
• Python: The primary programming language used for data processing, model 
training, and evaluation. 
• TensorFlow/Keras: Used for building, training, and evaluating the CNN model. 
• Scikit-learn: Used for building and evaluating the Random Forest model. 
• Gradio: Used for deploying the trained model as a real-time web application for 
MRI image classification.
